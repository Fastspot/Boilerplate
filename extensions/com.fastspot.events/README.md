Events
======

The Events extension implements an admin interface for users to add events to an event calendar including recurring events with the following recurrence types:
- Daily
- Weekly (on a given day -- i.e. Thursday)
- Monthly (on a given day or given week & day of each month -- i.e. 1st of every month or 1st Friday of every month)
- Yearly (on a given day)

The admin provides a search interface and calendar interface for editing specific occurences of events as well as a simple list view for editing the "main" event entries.

The BTXEvents class is provided with many useful methods for pulling event data to the front end of your website.
