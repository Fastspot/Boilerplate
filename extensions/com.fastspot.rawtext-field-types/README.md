Raw Text Field Types
====================

This extension implements the "Raw Text" and "Raw Text Area" field types. 
These field types behave exactly the same as the normal "Text" and "Text Area" field types with the exception that they do no encode HTML characters (so you can dump HTML into them).

Compatibility
-------------
These field types are bundled as an extension for BigTree 4.2 and higher.

Licensing
---------
These field types are publicly licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).
If you would like to use these field types under a different license, please [contact us](mailto:info@fastspot.com).
